A template project for Erlang using EUnit and Rebar.

You will need to have a standard installation of Erlang installed.

A version of Rebar that runs on OSX, and should also work on Linux is included
in the root of the erlang project.

To run the tests, cd to the starting_points/erlang directory (the same
directory that contains this file), and run

   ./rebar eunit

NOTES

The first two lines of world tick might be moved out so that they can work on a
subset of the living cells. Then return a dict with counts for each subset.
These dicts could then be merged. This would allow multiple erlang processes to
crunch the explode and count. Could even have the work parcelled off as each
set of living cells are read in. Might mean we could work on more cells than
can fit in memory on one machine. When each process completes the dicts could
be merged at the master. The master would sit there looping and waiting for new
dicts to pull into it's own.
